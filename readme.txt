Welcome! 

Bounce is a 3D physics engine for games and interactive applications.

See building.txt to read how to build Bounce. Bounce comes with a Visual Studio 2015 build by default.

See documenting.txt to read how to generate the documentation for Bounce.

Bounce has no external dependencies. The external dependencies contained inside the root of the 
solution tree are for the testbed. Therefore, you should copy include/bounce and src/bounce and put 
them into your project dependencies if you don't need anything from the testbed.

Have a great time using the engine for your purposes.
