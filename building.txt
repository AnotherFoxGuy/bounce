Bounce uses premake for generating project files in a platform agnostic manner. 

Grab premake from https://premake.github.io/.
Put premake into bounce/.

Visual Studio 2017

Ensure you have installed the Visual Studio 2015 libraries.
Say { premake5 vs2017 } on a command line. 
Open build/vs2017/bounce.sln.
Set testbed as the startup project.
In the testbed debugging properties, set the Working Directory to ..\..\examples\testbed.
Press F5 to run.

Linux

On a clean Ubuntu 16.04 install these packages first:

mesa-common-dev
libgl1-mesa-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev 

x32

Say { premake5 gmake } on a terminal.
From build/gmake say { make config="debug_x32" }.
Set the testbed directory as the working directory
Open testbed from /bin/x32/testbed/.

x64

Say { premake5 gmake } on a terminal.
From build/gmake say { make config="debug_x64" }.
Set the testbed directory as the working directory
Open testbed from /bin/x64/testbed/.

Mac

I don't run Mac currently and therefore can't test the build system in this platform.
