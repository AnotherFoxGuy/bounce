Bounce uses premake for generating project files in a platform agnostic manner. 

Grab premake from http://industriousone.com/premake.
Put premake.exe into bounce/.

Visual Studio 2015

Open bounce/bat.
Open premake_vs2015.bat. This will run a premake script and open bounce/build/vs2015/bounce.sln.
Set testbed as the startup project.
Press F5 or Ctrl-F5 to run.

premake files for building on Mac will be available later because I don't run Mac currently and 
therefore can't test the build system in this platform.
